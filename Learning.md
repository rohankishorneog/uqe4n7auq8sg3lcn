I have learend while keeping static files in public folder, it is necesssery to use process.env.PUBLIC_URl so that it works both in development and production environments.



//Apart from  this,  I have also trying to learn nextJS, as i feel it is a very good framework for development. 

I am also interested in making destop and mobile applications so i plan to learn ElectronJS and React Native as well.

As for my personal favourite, I am very interested in learning threeJS too, so that I can improve the creative side of myself .
And other environments like bun instead of Nodejs, I am very interesed in the new technologies that are coming out.
